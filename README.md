The project focuses on Named Entity Recognition (NER), a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) aimed at identifying and categorizing entities within text, such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more. In recent years, the emergence of transformer-based models, notably BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), has reshaped the landscape of NER, offering cutting-edge performance across a spectrum of NLP tasks. This project explores the fine-tuning of BERT specifically for Named Entity Recognition, covering essential aspects such as understanding NER tasks and datasets, configuring BERT models, and implementing fine-tuning pipelines tailored to our project's objectives. Through this exploration, we aim to leverage the power of BERT to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of entity recognition within our domain-specific text data.
